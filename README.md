<h1>Housing Sales Prices & Venues Data Analysis of Baton Rouge, LA</h1>
<h2>Introduction/Business Problem</h2>
<h3>General Description & Discussion of the Background</h3>
                <p>Baton Rouge is the capital city of Louisiana. There are 220,236 people living in Baton Rouge alone,
                    making it the second largest city in Louisiana behind New Orleans.
                    There are over 800,000 people living in the Baton Rouge metropolitan area, and the population has
                    grown 3.4% within the past 10 years.
                    I will be focusing on East Baton Rouge Parish, the most populated parish in the Baton Rouge
                    Metropolitan area. **</p>
                <p>It is home to Louisiana State University (LSU), one of the top-rated universities in Louisiana. LSU
                    is very cheap for both in and out of state students combined with having a high acceptance rate
                    means
                    there are always new students moving into Baton Rouge. Freshman are required to live on campus their
                    first year.
                    It is also the 9th largest port in the United States. Workers come and go from the Mississippi River
                    with goods to ship and hungry bellies every day. </p>
                <p>All these residents and workers need a place to eat. Students get tired of dining halls and don't
                    have kitchens in their dorms.
                    Shipping workers are excited to have a real meal after coming from overseas. Regular working-class
                    adults sometimes forget or are too lazy to cook for themselves.
                    Louisiana has a very diverse food culture and almost all styles of food have a place in Baton
                    Rouge. </p>
<h3>Target Audience</h3>
                <p> Restaurants are a great investment, if planned properly. Unfortunately, almost half of all
                    restaurants fail during the first year of opening. My target audience would be anyone who is looking
                    to start in the
                    restaurant business within Baton Rouge area. There are many factors to consider such as location,
                    service style, and the actual food being sold. </p>
                </p>It is essential to understand the variety of restaurants in each neighborhood. Identifying a market
                gap within a specific neighborhood could lead to that restaurant being
                successful. Versus opening a restaurant in a neighborhood that doesnâ€™t need your food and failing. </p>
                <p class="text-muted">**For those unfamiliar with Louisiana, a parish is akin to a county in other
                    states.</p>
<h3>Data</h3>
                <p>Restaurant location is a complex issue in order to answer this I will use Zillow <span><a
                        href="https://www.zillow.com/baton-rouge-la/home-values/">(1)</a></span>, a popular house
                    purchasing website, data to get housing information for demographics of each neighborhood.</p>
                <p>Additionally, I will use the foursquare API <span><a href="https://foursquare.com/">(2)</a></span> to
                    get a better understanding of the competition within each area by looking at the types of
                    restaurants that are available in each neighborhood to see which is common and which is popular.</p>
